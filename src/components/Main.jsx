            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am an aspiring software developer with an interest in becoming a full stack developer. I enjoy learning new technologies and finding ways to apply them in both my personal and professional life. I try to approach my work with the acknowledgement that I am not perfect but every day I can strive to be better than I was the day before.Just like software development, professional development is an iterative process.</p>
            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>I'm a family man who enjoys spending time with his wife and two daughters. Outside of that I'm an avid book reader, mostly historical fiction. I enjoy running and am part of a local running club. I've done several half marathons but my long term goal is to one day work up the courage to do a full marathon.</p>
